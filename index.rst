203341 Genetics and Evolution
=============================

These are the web-pages for the course 203341. You will learn how to analyse next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The data you will be using is actual research data. The final aim is to identify the genome variations in evolved lines of wild yeast that can explain the observed biological phenotypes.

To this end, you will learn to:

- Make use of a UNIX-based computer environment
- Create a genome assembly of the ancestor based on NGS data
- Annotate a newly derived genome
- Map NGS reads of evolved lines to the ancestor genome
- Call genome variations/mutations in the evolved lines
- Identify the genes responsible for the observed evolved phenotypes
