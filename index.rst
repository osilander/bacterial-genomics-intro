Bacterial Genomics Tutorial
===============================

This is an introductory tutorial for learning computational genomics mostly on the Linux command-line. It is part of the Genome Science course at MAssey University, currently taught by `Olin Silander <https://www.silanderlab.com/>`_.


The tutorial outlines how to analyse real-world next-generation sequencing (NGS) data that is from a research lab.
The final aim is to identify genome variations in evolved lines of wild bacteria that can explain the observed biological phenotypes.

A large part of this tutorial was written by `Sebastian Schmeier <https://www.schmeierlab.com>`_, who taught Genome Science from 2016-2020.
