NGS - Taxonomic investigation
=============================

Overview
--------

We want to investigate if there are sequences of other species in our collection
of sequences DNA pieces. We know most of them are from our species that we try
to assemble. However, lets investigate if we have possibly sequences from other
species sequenced maybe through contamination.

We will use the tool `Kraken <https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/>`__ to assign
taxonomic classifications to our sequence reads. Let us see if we can id some
sequences from other fungi or even bacteria.
