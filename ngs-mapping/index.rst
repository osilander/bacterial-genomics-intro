Mapping sequence reads to a reference genome
--------------------------------------------

Now that we have assembled a reference genome for our *ancestral* clone, we want to identify the changes that have occurred in the *evolved* clone. There are at lteast two possible ways to do this. One option would be to assemble a second genome for our evolved clone and compare this to the ancestral genome. However, this would be the wrong approach for two reasons. First, it is more computationally difficult to peform another assembly. Thus, we would be wasting time and effort and computational resources. Second, we would not get any measure of how *sure* we could be that a change occurred. For these reasons we will instead **map** our reads onto the genome that we have assembled in the section :ref:`ngs-assembly`. We will then figure out which mutations have occurred. This process is often denoted *calling vraiants*.

To map reads and call variants we will now use the second set of Illumina reads that you have, those from the evolved clone. Make sure that those are the ones you are dealing with today. First, we will go through the process of mapping them, and then we will add a rule to our ``snakefile`` that spceifies the input and output files tht we need, and the method used to create them.

First, you need to make sure that the reads you are using have been trimmed using |fastp|. If they are not, please go ahead and do that. For reference on how to use ``fastp``, see QC section :ref:`ngs-qc` or refer to your ``snakefile``.

We are going to use the quality trimmed forward and backward DNA sequences of the evolved line and use a program called |bwa| to map the reads.

.. todo::

   #. Discuss briefly why we are using the ancestral genome as a reference genome as opposed to a genome for the evolved line.


Installing the software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are going to use a program called |bwa| to map our reads to our genome. Please install it now using ``conda``.


BWA
---


Overview
~~~~~~~~

|bwa| is a versatile read aligner that can take a reference genome and map single- or paired-end data to it [LI2009]_. The method that it uses for this is the Burrows-Wheeler transform, and it was one of the first read aligners to adopt this strategy (with ``bowtie``).

|bwa| first requires an indexing step for which you need to supply the reference genome. In subsequent steps this index will be used for aligning the reads to the reference genome. The general command structure of the |bwa| tools we are going to use are shown below:

.. code:: bash

   # bwa index help
   bwa index

   # This is just indexing
   # You only need your Unicycler assembly here
   bwa index path/to/reference-genome.fasta

   # bwa mem help
   bwa mem

   # paired-end mapping, general command structure, adjust to your case
   # name you file SENSIBLY
   # For this you need your ancestor assembly and your reads
   # from your evolved lines
   bwa mem path/to/reference-genome.fasta path/to/read1.fastq path/to/read2.fastq > path/to/aln-pe.sam


Create an |bwa| index for your reference genome assembly now using the ``bwa index`` command. Attention! Remember which file you need to submit to |bwa|.

.. attention::

   If you have not used your |unicycler| assembly as your reference, go back and do that now.

.. attention::

   If you are writing the ``bwa index`` and ``bwa mem`` steps as rules in your ``Snakefile``, this will be a little bit tricky. This is because the ``bwa index`` step has no explicit output. For this reason you need to generate an empty (fake) output. This can be done as illustrated below. Note that what we are doing is creating an empty file using ``touch()``. All this does is tell us that the indexing has been done and that it has worked on the current assembly. And Remember to UPDATE your rule all :)

.. code:: bash

    rule index:
      input:
        "results/my_assembly.fasta"
      output:
        touch("results/index.done")
      shell:
        """
        bwa index {input}
        """

.. attention::

   (continued from above). Once you have done this, you  will need to use this file (``index.done``) as **input** for your next mapping rule (probably something like ``bwa_mapping``), like so:


.. code:: bash

    rule bwa_mapping:
      input:
        assembly="results/my_assembly.fasta",
        R1="results/{strain}_R1.fastq",
        R2="results/{strain}_R2.fastq",
        index="results/index.done"
      output:
        "results/{strain}_mapped.sam"
      shell:
        """
        bwa mem {input.assembly} {input.R1} {input.R2} > {output}
        """


Mapping reads in a paired-end manner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have created our index, it is time to map the filtered and trimmed sequencing reads of our evolved line to the reference genome. Use the correct ``bwa mem`` command structure from above and map the reads of the evolved line to the reference genome. This process will take 2-3 minutes to complete.


.. _sam-file-format:

The sam mapping file-format
---------------------------

|bwa| will produce a mapping file in ``sam`` format (Sequence Alignment/Map). Have a look into the sam-file that was created by either program.
A quick overview of the ``sam`` format can be found `here <http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml#4>`__.
Briefly, first there are a set of header lines for each file detailing what information is contained in the file. Then, for each read, that mapped to the reference, there is one line with information about the read in 12 different columns.

The columns of such a line in the mapping file are described in :numref:`table-sam`.

.. _table-sam:
.. table:: The sam-file format fields.

   +-----+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

   +-----+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

One line of a mapped read can be seen here:

.. code:: bash

    M02810:197:000000000-AV55U:1:1101:10000:11540   83      NODE_1_length_1419525_cov_15.3898       607378  60      151M    =       607100  -429    TATGGTATCACTTATGGTATCACTTATGGCTATCACTAATGGCTATCACTTATGGTATCACTTATGACTATCAGACGTTATTACTATCAGACGATAACTATCAGACTTTATTACTATCACTTTCATATTACCCACTATCATCCCTTCTTTA FHGHHHHHGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHHHHHHHHHHHGHHHHHGHHHHHHHHGDHHHHHHHHGHHHHGHHHGHHHHHHFHHHHGHHHHIHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHHHHHGHGHHHHHHHHEGGGGGGGGGFBCFFFFCCCCC NM:i:0  MD:Z:151        AS:i:151        XS:i:0

Mpst importantly, this line defines the read name, the position in the reference genome where the read maps, and the quality of the mapping.


Mapping post-processing
-----------------------

Fix mates and compress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because aligners can sometimes leave unusual `SAM flag <http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml#4>`__ information on SAM records, it is helpful when working with many tools to first clean up read pairing information and flags with |samtools|.
We are going to produce also compressed bam output for efficient storing of and access to the mapped reads. To understand why we are going to compress the file, take a look at the size of your original ``fastq`` files that you used for mapping, and the size of the ``sam`` file that resulted. Along the way toward compressing, we will also sort our reads for easier access. This simply means we will order the reads by the position in the genoome that they map to. 

To perform all of these steps, we will rely on a powerful quite of software tools that are implemented in ``samtools``. The first of these, then is ``sort``. One very important aspect of ``samtools`` that you should always remember is that in almost all cases **the default behaviour of ``samtools`` is to output to the terminal (standard out)**. For that reason, we will be using the redirect arrow ``>`` quite a bit. In other cases, we will use the "pipe" operator ``|``. We use the pipe operator so that we do not have to deal with intermediate files.

First, we use ``samtools fixmate``, which according to its documentation, can be used to: "Fill in mate coordinates, ISIZE and mate related flags from a name-sorted or name-collated alignment." Here, ``ISIZE`` refers to insert size.


Note, ``samtools fixmate`` expects **name-sorted** input files, which we can achieve with ``samtools sort -n``.


.. code:: bash

   # -n sorts by name
   # -O sam outputs sam format
   samtools sort -n -O sam my_mapped_file.sam > my_mapped_sorted.sam

Next, we need to take this name-sorted by and give it to ``samtools fixmate`` . This will fill in our extra fields. We will also output in compressed ``.bam`` format.

- ``-m``: Add ms (mate score) tags. These are used by markdup (below) to select the best reads to keep.
- ``-O bam``: specifies that we want compressed bam output from fixmate.

.. code:: bash

   # -O bam outputs bam format
   samtools fixmate -m -O bam my_mapped_sorted.sam my_mapped_fixmate.bam

.. attention::

   Make sure that you are following the file naming conventions for your suffixes. Simple mapped files will be in ``.sam`` format and should be denoted by that suffix. The *compressed* version will be in ``.bam`` format, and be denoted by that suffix.

Once we have this fixmate bam-file, delete the ``.sam`` files as they take up a significant amount of space. Use ``rm`` to do this, but **be careful because ``rm`` is forever**.

We will be using the `SAM flag <http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml#4>`__ information later below to extract specific alignments.

.. hint::

   A very useful tools to explain samtools flags can be found `here <http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html>`__.


Sorting by location
~~~~~~~

We are going to use |samtools| again to sort the ``.bam`` file into **coordinate order**:


.. code:: bash

    # sort by location
    # -O indicates bam output again
    # note the redirect > arrow
    samtools sort -O bam my_mapped_fixmate.bam > my_mapped_sorted.bam


Remove duplicates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this step we remove duplicate reads. The main purpose of removing duplicates is to mitigate the effects of PCR amplification bias introduced during library construction.
**It should be noted that this step is not always recommended.**
It depends on the research question.
In SNP calling it is a good idea to remove duplicates, as the statistics used in the tools that call SNPs sub-sequently expect this (most tools anyways).
However, for other research questions that use mapping, you might not want to remove duplicates, e.g. RNA-seq.

.. code:: bash

    # Markdup can simply *mark* the duplicate reads
    # But the -r option tells it to remove those reads.
    # the -S also tells it to remove supplementary mappings
    # This works on a very simple principal that we will discuss
    samtools markdup -r -S my_mapped_sorted.bam my_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam

.. todo::

   Exlpain what "PCR amplification bias" means and discuss why it might not be used for RNA-seq experiments.


Mapping statistics
------------------

Stats with SAMtools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets get a mapping overview. For this we will use the ``samtools flagstat`` tool, which simply looks in your ``bam`` file for the `flags <http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html>` of each read and summarises them. The usage is as below:


.. code:: bash

    samtools flagstat my_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam


.. todo::

   Look at the mapping statistics and understand `their meaning
   <https://www.biostars.org/p/12475/>`__. Discuss your results.

For the sorted ``bam`` file we can also get read depth for at all positions of the reference genome, e.g. how many reads are overlapping the genomic position. We can get some very quick statistics on this using ``samtools coverage``. Type that command to view the required input, and try using that now.

We can also get considerably more detailed data using ``samtools depth``, used as below. Again note that here, as with almost all commands above, we are using the redirect ``>`` arrow.


.. code:: bash

    samtools depth my_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam > my_mapping_depth.txt

This will give us a file with three columns: the name of the contig, the position in the contig,  and the depth. This looks something like this:

.. code:: bash
    
    # let's look at the first ten lines using head
    head my_mapping_depth.txt

    1 1 97
    1 2 97
    1 3 99
    1 4 99
    1 5 100
    1 6 100
    1 7 103
    1 8 103
    1 9 104
    1 10  107


Now we quickly use some |R| to get some stats on this data. **Skip this section if you are short on time**.

Open an |R| shell by typing ``R`` on the command-line of the shell.

.. code:: R
   
   # here we read in the data
   my.depth <- read.table('my_mapping_depth.txt', sep='\t', header=FALSE)

   # Look at the beginning of x
   # to make sure we've loaded it correctly
   head(my.depth)

   # calculate average depth
   mean(my.depth[,3])
   # std dev
   sd(my.depth[,3])

   # a quick pdf of coverage
   # here we look at contig 1 and only plot eavery 100th point
   # Please excuse this briefly complicated syntax
   # every 100th point
   plot.points <- seq(min(my.depth[,2]), max(my.depth[,2]),by=100)
   pdf('my_depth.pdf', width = 12, height = 4)
   plot(my.depth[plot.points,2], my.depth[plot.points,3], pch=19, xlab='Position', ylab='Coverage')
   dev.off()

The result plot will be looking similar to the one in :numref:`coverage`

.. _coverage:
.. figure:: images/covNODE20.png

   A example coverage plot for a contig with highlighted in red regions with a coverage below 20 reads.


Stats with QualiMap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a more in depth analysis of the mappings, one can use |qualimap| [OKO2015]_.

|qualimap| examines sequencing alignment data in SAM/BAM files according to the features of the mapped reads and provides an overall view of the data that helps to the detect biases in the sequencing and/or mapping of the data and eases decision-making for further analysis.

Installation:


.. code::

   conda install qualimap


Run |qualimap| with:


.. code:: bash

   qualimap bamqc -bam my_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam


This will create a report in the mapping folder. The name of this report will be similar to ``my_mapped_sorted_dedup_stats``
See this `webpage <http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/doc_html/analysis.html#output>`__ to get help on the sections in the report.


.. todo::

   Install |qualimap| and investigate the mapping of the evolved sample. Write
   down your observations.

Sub-selecting reads
-------------------

It is important to remember that the mapping commands we used above, without additional parameters to sub-select specific alignments (e.g. for |bowtie| there are options like ``--no-mixed``, which suppresses unpaired alignments for paired reads or ``--no-discordant``, which suppresses discordant alignments for paired reads, etc.), are going to output all reads, including unmapped reads, multi-mapping reads, unpaired reads, discordant read pairs, etc. in one file.
We can sub-select from the output reads we want to analyse further using |samtools|.


Concordant reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can select read-pair that have been mapped in a correct manner (same chromosome/contig, correct orientation to each other, distance between reads is not non-sensical). For this, we will use another ``samtools`` utility, ``view``, which converts between ``bam`` and ``sam`` format. We do this here because it outputs to standard out, and we extract reads that have the correct `flag <https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html>`_.


.. code:: bash

   samtools view -h -b -f 3 my_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam > my_mapped_sorted_dedup_concordant.bam

- ``-h``: Include the sam header
- ``-b``: Output will be bam-format
- ``-f 3``: Only extract correctly paired reads. ``-f`` extracts alignments with the specified `SAM flag <http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml#4>`__ set.


.. todo::

   Explain what concordant and discordant read pairs are? Look at the |bowtie| manual.


.. todo::

   Our final aim is to identify variants. For a particular class of variants, it is not the best idea to only focus on concordant reads. Why is that?


Quality-based sub-selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, in this section we want to sub-select reads based on the quality of the mapping.
It seems a reasonable idea to only keep good mapping reads.
As the SAM-format contains at column 5 the :math:`MAPQ` value, which we established earlier is the "MAPping Quality" in Phred-scaled, this seems easily achieved.
The formula to calculate the :math:`MAPQ` value is: :math:`MAPQ=-10*log10(p)`, where :math:`p` is the probability that the read is mapped wrongly.
However, there is a problem!
**While the MAPQ information would be very helpful indeed, the way that various tools implement this value differs.**
A good overview can be found `here <https://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/mapq-values-are-really-useful-but-their-implementation-is-a-mess/>`__.
The bottom-line is that we need to be aware that different tools use this value in different ways and the it is good to know the information that is encoded in the value.
Once you dig deeper into the mechanics of the :math:`MAPQ` implementation it becomes clear that this is not an easy topic.
If you want to know more about the :math:`MAPQ` topic, please follow the link above.

For the sake of going forward, we will sub-select reads with at least medium quality as defined by |bowtie|. Again, here  we use the ``samtools view`` tool, but this time use the ``-q`` option to select by quality.

.. code:: bash

   samtools view -h -b -q 20 my_mapped_sorted_dedup_concordant.bam > my_mapped_sorted_dedup_concordant.q20.bam

- ``-h``: Include the sam header
- ``-q 20``: Only extract reads with mapping quality >= 20


.. hint::

   I will repeat here a recommendation given at the source `link <https://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/mapq-values-are-really-useful-but-their-implementation-is-a-mess/>`__ above, as it is a good one: If you unsure what :math:`MAPQ` scoring scheme is being used in your own data then you can plot out the :math:`MAPQ` distribution in a BAM file using programs like the mentioned |qualimap| or similar programs.
   This will at least show you the range and frequency with which different :math:`MAPQ` values appear and may help identify a suitable threshold you may want to use.


Unmapped reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will use |kraken| in section :ref:`taxonomic-investigation` to classify all unmapped sequence reads and identify the species they are coming from and test for contamination. To achieve this we need to figure out which reads were unmapped, and then extract the sequence of those reads.

Lets see how to get the unmapped portion of the reads from the bam-file:


.. code:: bash

    samtools view -b -f 4 my_mapped_sorted_dedup.bam > my_mapped_sorted_dedup_unmapped.bam

    # count them
    samtools view -c my_mapped_sorted_dedup_unmapped.bam


- ``-b``: indicates that the output is BAM.
- ``-f INT``: only include reads with this `SAM flag <http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml#4>`__ set. You can also use the command ``samtools flags`` to get an overview of the flags.
- ``-c``: count the reads


Lets extract the fastq sequence of the unmapped reads for read1 and read2. We will use this next time to figure out what organisms these reads might come from. Note that there are several complications here: we output to ``fastq`` format, and we separate into ``R1`` and ``R2``. Here we use a new tool, ``bamToFastq``. This is part of the ``bedtools`` suite of tools, and of course for that we first need to install ``bedtools`` using conda :) . Go ahead and do that now.

Finally, we extract the ``fastq`` files:


.. code:: bash

    bamToFastq -i my_mapped_sorted_dedup_unmapped.bam -fq my_mapped_sorted_dedup_unmapped.R1.fastq -fq2  my_mapped_sorted_dedup_unmapped.R2.fastq
